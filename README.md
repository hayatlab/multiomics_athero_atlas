# Spatial and single-cell transcriptomic atlas of human atherosclerosis

To gain further insights in the spatial mechanism of human atherosclerosis we generated novel spatial transcriptomics data from human samples with different stages of atherosclerosis and integrated it with single-cell RNA-sequencing from different studies. Using our multi-modal atlas, we elucidate cell type functions and spatial niches within the human artery with previously unrecognized aspects of atherosclerosis. Here we present the different approaches of this work.

## Workflow of the multi-modal human atherosclerosis atlas:
The analysis of the integrated single-cell RNA-seq data and spatial transcriptomics (10X Visium) were performed as described in the following sections: 

-	01 – QC and data integration
-	02 – Cell type annotations scRNA-seq atlas
-	03 – Functional analysis of scRNA-seq atlas

-	04 – Spatial deconvolution
-	05 – Spatial distributions
-	06 – Spatial Cell-Cell Communication

## Data
Raw data: TBD

## Reference
The manuscript has been submitted for peer-review
